    persistent, multi-level undo tree
    extensive plugin system
    support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats
    powerful search and replace
    integrates with many tools

* Colorscheme
    I am using a royal colorscheme this is the reason i have a colorful screen text
    
* Devions 
    As you can see on the above picture in the nerd tree there is the icon for folder and programming languauge like c++ and py
    
* Powerline 
    The bar that you see the the bottom of the screen that contains information of the files including the programming language name used
    
* Auto pairs
    This just helps to auto pairs your brackets

    I am using a onedark theme
